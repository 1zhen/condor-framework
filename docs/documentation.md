# What is Condor-Framework?

Condor is a minimalist, fast framework for building GRPC services in Node JS. It's like **express** for **GRPC**.

## Status

Condor is working, but it's in *ALPHA* stage. We're using it to build a large system that will be in production soon.

## Highlights

- Built on top of Google's [grpc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grpc) module
- Focus on simplicity and high performance
- Fully covered by tests
- Promise based, which means **no callbacks**
- Written using, and design for **ES6**
